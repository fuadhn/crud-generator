# KUCRUD - CodeIgniter CRUD Generator
KUCRUD is a CodeIgniter starter project to save your time. Uses the Grocery CRUD library, but it's the next level of Grocery CRUD. Why? Since you don't need to code, just build your database and let me code yours.

# Installation
- Download/duplicate this repository.
- Create a database.
- Open the database configuration by editing the [app/Config/Database.php file](https://github.com/fuadhn/crud-generator/blob/main/app/Config/Database.php).
- CRUD Generator is ready to save you time.

Now is the time to simplify each of your jobs, there are still many other jobs waiting :)
